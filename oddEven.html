//can you figure out how to make it (you're going to have to google) also print out "I'm even!" when it's even and "I'm odd" when it's odd?

<!-- goal: make a div so that when you click on it, it has one background image and then when you click on it again, it has another background image.

	How to make this:

	1. make a div, styled it so we can see it.
	2. make a variable in JS that points to that div
	3. add an event listener that's listening for a click
	4. Running a function that's a) counting the clicks BY.... ___________

	b) if the clicks are even (the definition of which is if the click number divided by 2 and the remainder is zero THEN add this image or toggle some css)

	c) if else or if the clicks of odd (definition of odd: if the click number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1) then add the other image.
